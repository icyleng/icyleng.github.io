       <p>
           Children, I come back today<br>
        <h3>To tell you</h3>
           a story of the long dark way<br>
           That I had to climb, that I had to know<br>
           In order that the race might live and grow.<br>
           Look at my face -- dark as the night --<br>
           Yet shining like the sun with love's true light.<br>
           I am the dark girl who crossed the red sea<br>
           Carrying in my body the seed of the free.<br>
           I am the woman who worked in the field<br>
           Bringing the cotton and the corn to yield.<br>
           I am the one who labored as a slave,<br>
           Beaten and mistreated for the work that I gave --<br>
           Children sold away from me, I'm husband sold, too.<br>
           No safety , no love, no respect was I due.<br><br>
           Three hundred years in the deepest South:<br>
           But God put a song and a prayer in my mouth.<br>
           God put a dream like steel in my soul.<br>
           Now, through my children, I'm reaching the goal.<br><br>
           Now, through my children, young and free,<br>
           I realized the blessing deed to me.<br>
        <h3>I couldn't</h3>
           read then. I couldn't write.<br>
           I had nothing, back there in the night.<br>
           Sometimes, the valley was filled with tears,<br>
        <h3>But</h3>
           I kept trudging on through the lonely years.<br>
        <h3>Sometimes, </h3>
           the road was hot with the sun,<br>
           But I had to keep on till my work was done:<br>
           I had to keep on! No stopping for me --<br>
           I was the seed of the coming Free.<br>
           I nourished the dream that nothing could smother<br>
           Deep in my breast -- the Negro mother.<br>
           I had only hope then , but now through you,<br>
           Dark ones of today, my dreams must come true:<br>
           All you dark children in the world out there,<br>
           Remember my sweat, my pain, my despair.<br>
           And make of those years a torch for tomorrow.<br>
           Make of my pass a road to the light<br>
           Out of the darkness, the ignorance, the night.<br>
           Lift high my banner out of the dust.<br>
           Stand like free men supporting my trust.<br>
           Believe in the right, let none push you back.<br>
           Remember the whip and the slaver's track.<br>
           Remember how the strong in struggle and strife<br>
           Still bar you the way, and deny you life --<br>
           But march ever forward, breaking down bars.<br>
           Look ever upward at the sun and the stars.<br>
           Oh, my dark children, may my dreams and my prayers<br>
           Impel you forever up the great stairs --<br>
           For I will be with you till no white brother<br>
           Dares keep down the children of the Negro Mother.<br>
