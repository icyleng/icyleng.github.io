              Theme For English B
              By Langston Hughes
     </div>
      <p>
              The instructor said,
              Then, it will be true.
              I wonder if it's that simple?
              I am twenty-two, colored, born in Winston-Salem.
              I went to school there, then Durham, then here
              to this college on the hill above Harlem.
              I am the only colored student in my class.
              The steps from the hill lead down into Harlem,
              through a park, then I cross St. Nicholas,
              Eighth Avenue, Seventh, and I come to the Y,
              the Harlem Branch Y, where I take the elevator
              up to my room, sit down, and write this page:<br>

              It's not easy to know what is true for you or me
              at twenty-two, my age. But I guess I'm what
              I feel and see and hear, Harlem, I hear you:
              hear you, hear me--we two--you, me, talk on this page.
              (I hear New York, too.)<br>

              Me--who?<br>
              Well, I like to eat, sleep, drink, and be in love.
              I like to work, read, learn, and understand life.
              I like a pipe for a Christmas present,
              or records--Bessie, bop, or Bach.<br>

              I guess being colored doesn't make me not like
              the same things other folks like who are other races.
              So will my page be colored that I write?<br>

              Being me, it will not be white.
              But it will be
              a part of you, instructor.
              You are white--
              yet a part of me, as I am a part of you.
              That's American.<br>

              Sometimes perhaps you don't want to be a part of me.
              Nor do I often want to be a part of you.
              But we are,that's true!
              although you're older--and white--
              and somewhat more free.<br>
