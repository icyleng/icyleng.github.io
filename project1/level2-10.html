         You've asked me what the lobster is weaving there with<br>
         his golden feet?<br>
         I reply, the ocean knows this.<br>
         You say, what is the ascidia waiting for in its transparent<br>
         <h2>
         bell? What is it waiting for?<br></h2>
         I tell you it is waiting for time, like you.<br>
         Study, study it, at a certain hour, in a certain sea I know.<br>
         You question me about the wicked tusk of the narwhal,<br>
         <h3>
         and I reply by describing<br></h3>
         how the sea unicorn with the harpoon in it dies.<br>
         You enquire about the kingfisher's feathers,<br>
         <h2>which tremble in the pure springs of the southern tides?<br></h2>
         Or you've found in the cards a new question touching on<br>
         the crystal architecture<br>
         of the sea anemone, and you'll deal that to me now?<br>
         <h4>You want to understand the electric nature of the ocean<br></h4>
         <h2>spines?</h2>
         <h6>
          armored stalactite that breaks as it walks?<br>
         The hook of the angler fish, the music stretched out<br>
         in the deep places like a thread in the water?<br>
         I want to tell you the ocean knows this, that life in its<br></h6>
         <h2>jewel boxes<br></h2>
         is endless as the sand, impossible to count, pure,<br>
         <h3>and among the blood-colored grapes time has made the<br></h3>
         <h5>  petal<br>
         hard and shiny, made the jellyfish full of light<br>
         and untied its knot, letting its musical threads fall<br></h5>
         from a horn of plenty made of infinite mother-of-pearl.<br>
         I am nothing but the empty net which has gone on ahead<br>
         of human eyes, dead in those darknesses,<br>
         of fingers accustomed to the triangle, longitudes<br>
         <h3>on the timid globe of an orange.<br></h3>
         <h5>I walked around as you do, investigating<br>
         the endless star,<br>
         and in my net, during the night, I woke up naked,<br></h5>
         the only thing caught, a fish trapped inside the wind.<br>
