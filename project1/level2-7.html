     <h1>Tonight I Can Write by Pablo Neruda
     </h1>
     <p id="highlight">Tonight I can write the saddest lines.<br>

<a id="highlight" href="www.google.com">Write, for example, 'The night is starry<br>
and the stars are blue and shiver in the distance.'<br></a>

The night wind revolves in the sky and sings.<br>

Tonight I can write the saddest lines.<br>
I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too.<br>

<h6 id="highlight">Through nights like this one I held her in my arms.<br>
I kissed her again and again under the endless sky.<br>

She loved me, sometimes I loved her too.<br>
How could one not have loved her great still eyes.<br>

Tonight I can write the saddest lines.<br>
To think that I do not have her. To feel that I have lost her.</h6><br>

To hear the immense night, still more immense without her.<br>
And the verse falls to the soul like dew to the pasture.<br>

What does it matter that my love could not keep her.<br>
The night is starry and she is not with me.<br>

<h2 id="highlight">This is all. In the distance someone is singing. In the distance.<br>
My soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.</h2><br>

<a id="highlight" href="www.google.com">My sight tries to find her as though to bring her closer.<br>
My heart looks for her, and she is not with me.<br></a>

The same night whitening the same trees.<br>
We, of that time, are no longer the same.<br>

<h5 id="highlight">I no longer love her, that's certain, but how I loved her.<br>
My voice tried to find the wind to touch her hearing.<br>

Another's. She will be another's. As she was before my kisses.<br>
Her voice, her bright body. Her infinite eyes.<br>

I no longer love her, that's certain, but maybe I love her.<br>
Love is so short, forgetting is so long.</h5><br>

<a id="highlight" href="www.google.com">Because through nights like this one I held her in my arms<br>
my soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.<br></a>

Though this be the last pain that she makes me suffer<br>
and these the last verses that I write for her.<br>
