          <p>Very quietly I take my leave<br>
             As quietly as I came here;<br>
             Quietly I wave good-bye<br>
             To the rosy clouds in the western sky.<br><br>
             The golden willows by the riverside<br>
             Are young brides in the setting sun;<br>
             Their reflections on the shimmering waves<br>
             Always linger in the depth of my heart.<br><br>
             The floating heart growing in the sludge<br>
             Sways leisurely under the water;<br>
             In the gentle waves of Cambridge<br>
             I would be a water plant!<br><br>
             That pool under the shade of elm trees<br>
             Holds not water but the rainbow from the sky;<br>
             Shattered to pieces among the duckweeds<br>
             Is the sediment of a rainbow-like dream.<br><br>
             To seek a dream? Just to pole a boat upstream<br>
             To where the green grass is more verdant;<br>
             Or to have the boat fully loaded with starlight<br>
             And sing aloud in the splendor of starlight.<br><br>
             But I cannot sing aloud<br>
             Quietness is my farewell music;<br>
             Even summer insects heap silence for me<br>
             Silent is Cambridge tonight!<br><br>
             Very quietly I take my leave<br>
             As quietly as I came here;<br>
             Gently I flick my sleeves<br>
             Not even a wisp of cloud will I bring away
         </p>
