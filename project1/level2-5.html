     <p id="highlight">Walking Around by Pablo Neruda</p>

     <p id="poem">
     It so happens I am sick of being a man.<br>

     And it happens that I walk into tailorshops and movie<br>
   </p>

   <p id="poem">
     dried up, waterproof, like a swan made of felt<br>

     steering my way in a water of wombs and ashes.<br>

     The smell of barbershops makes me break into hoarse<br>
   </p>

     <h2>sobs</h2><br>

   <p id="poem">
     The only thing I want is to lie still like stones or wool.<br>

    The only thing I want is to see no more stores, no gardens,<br>

     no more goods, no spectacles, no elevators.<br>


     It so happens that I am sick of my feet and my nails<br>


     and my hair and my shadow.<br>

     It so happens I am sick of being a man.<br>

     Still it would be marvelous<br>


     to terrify a law clerk with a cut lily,<br>

     or kill a nun with a blow on the ear.<br>



     It would be great<br>

     to go through the streets with a green knife<br>


     letting out yells until I died of the cold.<br>


     I don't want to go on being a root in the dark,<br>

     insecure, stretched out, shivering with sleep,<br>

     going on down, into the moist guts of the earth,<br>

     taking in and thinking, eating every day.<br>


     I don't want so much misery.<br>

     I don't want to go on as a root and a tomb,<br>

     alone under the ground, a warehouse with corpses,<br>

     half frozen, dying of grief.<br>


     That's why Monday, when it sees me coming<br>

     with my convict face, blazes up like gasoline,<br>

     and it howls on its way like a wounded wheel,<br>

     and leaves tracks full of warm blood leading toward the<br>

     night.<br>


     And it pushes me into certain corners, into some moist<br>
   </p>

     <h2> houses,</h2><br>
   <p id="poem">
     into hospitals where the bones fly out the window,<br>

     into shoeshops that smell like vinegar,<br>

     and certain streets hideous as cracks in the skin.<br>

     There are sulphur-colored birds, and hideous intestines<br>

     hanging over the doors of houses that I hate,<br>

     and there are false teeth forgotten in a coffeepot,<br>

     there are mirrors<br>

     that ought to have wept from shame and terror,<br>

     there are umbrellas everywhere, and venoms, and umbilical<br>

     cords.<br>


     I stroll along serenely, with my eyes, my shoes,<br>

     my rage, forgetting everything,<br>

     I walk by, going through office buildings and orthopedic<br>
   </p>

     <h2><strong>
     shops,</strong></h2><br>
   <p id="poem">
     and courtyards with washing hanging from the line:<br>

     , towels and shirts from which slow<br>

    <h1><em>dirty tears are falling.</em></h1><br>

     </p>
          </body>
