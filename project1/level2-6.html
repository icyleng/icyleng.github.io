    <p id="highlight">Saddest Poem by Pablo Neruda</p>

    <p>
    I can write the saddest poem of all tonight.<br>
    varWrite, for instance: "The night is full of stars,<br>
    and the stars, blue, shiver in the distance."<br>
    The night wind whirls in the sky and sings.<br>
    I can write the saddest poem of all tonight.<br>
    I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too.<br> </p>


<h1>On nights like this, I held her in my arms.</h1>


<div id="parttwo">

  I kissed her so many times under the infinite sky.<br>
  She loved me, sometimes I loved her.<br>
  How could I not have loved her large, still eyes?<br>
<h2>I can write the saddest poem of all tonight.<br>
To think I don't have her. To feel that I've lost her.<br>
To hear the immense night, more immense without her.<br>
And the poem falls to the soul as dew to grass.<br></h2>
<h3>What does it matter that my love couldn't keep her.</h3>
The night is full of stars and she is not with me.<br>
<h4>That's all. Far away, someone sings. Far away.</h4>
My soul is lost without her.<br>
<h5>varAs if to bring her near, my eyes search for her.</h5>
My heart searches for her and she is not with me.<br>
The same night that whitens the same trees.<br>
<h5>
We, we who were, we are the same no longer.</h5>
<h6>
I no longer love her, true, but how much I loved her.<br>
My voice searched the wind to touch her ear.<br>
Someone else's. She will be someone else's. As she once<br>
belonged to my kisses.<br>
Her voice, her light body. Her infinite eyes.<br>
I no longer love her, true, but perhaps I love her.</h6>
Love is so short and oblivion so long.<br>
Because on nights like this I held her in my arms,<br>
my soul is lost without her.<br>
Although this may be the last pain she causes me,<br>
and this may be the last poem I write for her.<br></h6>
