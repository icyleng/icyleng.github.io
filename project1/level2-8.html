      <h1>A Dog Has Died by Pablo Neruda
      </h1>
      <p>My dog has died.<br>
         I buried him in the garden<br>
         next to a rusted old machine.<br><br>
         <a href="www.google.com">Some day I'll join him right there,<br>
                                  but now he's gone with his shaggy coat,<br></a>
         his bad manners and his cold nose,<br>
         and I, the materialist, who never believed<br>
         in any promised heaven in the sky<br>
         for any human being,<br>
         I believe in a heaven I'll never enter.<br>
         Yes, I believe in a heaven for all dogdom<br>
         where my dog waits for my arrival<br>
         waving his fan-like tail in friendship.<br><br><br>
         Ai, I'll not speak of sadness here on earth,<br>
         of having lost a companion<br>
         who was never servile.<br>
         <a href="www.google.com">His friendship for me, like that of a porcupine<br></a>
         withholding its authority,<br>
         was the friendship of a star, aloof,<br>
         with no more intimacy than was called for,<br>
         with no exaggerations:<br>
         he never climbed all over my clothes<br>
         filling me full of his hair or his mange,<br>
         he never rubbed up against my knee<br>
         like other dogs obsessed with sex.<br><br><br>
         <a href="www.google.com">No, my dog used to gaze at me,<br>
         paying me the attention I need,<br></a>
         the attention required<br>
         to make a vain person like me understand<br>
         that, being a dog, he was wasting time,<br>
         but, with those eyes so much purer than mine,<br>
         he'd keep on gazing at me<br>
         with a look that reserved for me alone<br>
         all his sweet and shaggy life,<br>
         always near me, never troubling me,<br>
         and asking nothing.<br><br><br>
         Ai, how many times have I envied his tail<br>
         as we walked together on the shores of the sea<br>
         in the lonely winter of Isla Negra<br>
         where the wintering birds filled the sky<br>
         and my hairy dog was jumping about<br>
         full of the voltage of the sea's movement:<br>
         my wandering dog, sniffing away<br>
         with his golden tail held high,<br>
         face to face with the ocean's spray.<br><br><br>
         Joyful, joyful, joyful,<br><br>
         as only dogs know how to be happy<br>
         with only the autonomy<br>
         of their shameless spirit.<br>
         There are no good-byes for my dog who has died,<br>
         and we don't now and never did lie to each other.<br>
         So now he's gone and I buried him,<br>
         and that's all there is to it.<br>
