     <h1>Ode To Wine by Pablo Neruda
     </h1>
     <p>
<div class="ode">Day-colored wine,<br><br>
night-colored wine,<br><br>
wine with purple feet<br><br>
or wine with topaz blood,<br><br>
wine,<br><br>
starry child<br><br>
of earth,<br><br>
wine, smooth<br><br>
as a golden sword,<br>
soft<br><br>
as lascivious velvet,<br><br>
wine, spiral-seashelled<br><br>
and full of wonder,<br><br>
amorous,<br><br>
marine;<br><br>
</div>

<div class="ode"><h2>never has one goblet contained you,<br>
one song, one man,<br>
you are choral, gregarious,<br>
at the least, you must be shared.<br>
At times<br>
you feed on mortal<br>
memories;<br>
your wave carries us<br>
from tomb to tomb,<br>
stonecutter of icy sepulchers,<br>
and we weep<br>
transitory tears;<br>
your<br>
glorious<br>
spring dress<br>
is different,<br>
blood rises through the shoots,<br>
wind incites the day,<br>
nothing is left<br>
of your immutable soul.<br>
Wine<br>
</h2></div>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<div class="ode"><h3>stirs the spring, happiness<br><br>
bursts through the earth like a plant,<br><br>
walls crumble,<br><br>
and rocky cliffs,<br><br>
chasms close,<br><br>
as song is born.<br><br>
A jug of wine, and thou beside me<br><br>
in the wilderness,<br><br>
sang the ancient poet.<br><br>
Let the wine pitcher<br><br>
add to the kiss of love its own.<br><br><br><br><br></h3></div>

<div class="ode">
  <ul>
  <h6>
    <li>My darling, suddenly<br><br></li>
<li>the line of your hip<br><br></li>
<li>becomes the brimming curve<br><br></li>
<li>of the wine goblet,<br><br></li>
<li>your breast is the grape cluster,<br><br></li>
<li>your nipples are the grapes,<br><br></li>
<li>the gleam of spirits lights your hair,<br><br></li>
<li>and your navel is a chaste seal<br><br></li>
<li>stamped on the vessel of your belly,<br><br></li>
<li>your love an inexhaustible<br><br></li>
<li>cascade of wine,<br><br></li>
<li>light that illuminates my senses,<br><br></li>
<li>the earthly splendor of life.<br><br><br><br><br></li>
<ul>
</h6></div>

<div class="ode"><h3>But you are more than love,<br><br>
the fiery kiss,<br><br>
the heat of fire,<br><br>
more than the wine of life;<br><br>
you are<br><br>
the community of man,<br><br>
translucency,<br><br>
chorus of discipline,<br><br>
abundance of flowers.<br><br>
I like on the table,<br><br>
when we're speaking,<br><br>
the light of a bottle<br><br>
of intelligent wine.<br><br>
<a href="www.google.com">Drink it,<br><br>
and remember in every<br><br>
drop of gold,<br><br></a>
in every topaz glass,<br><br>
in every purple ladle,<br><br>
that autumn labored<br><br>
to fill the vessel with wine;<br><br>
and in the ritual of his office,<br><br>
let the simple man remember<br><br>
to think of the soil and of his duty,<br><br>
to propagate the canticle of the wine.<br></h3></div>
