     <h1> Cloony The Clown by Shel Silverstein</h1>
     <p>

       Who worked in a circus that came through town.<br>
       His shoes were too big and his hat was too small,<br>
       But he just wasn't, just wasn't funny at all.<br>
       >He had a trombone to play loud silly tunes,<br>
       He had a green dog and a thousand balloons.<br>
       He was floppy and sloppy and skinny and tall,<br>
       But he just wasn't, just wasn't funny at all.<br>
       And every time he did a trick,<br>
       Everyone felt a little sick.<br>
       And every time he told a joke,<br>
       Folks sighed as if their hearts were broke.<br>
       And every time he lost a shoe,<br>
       Everyone looked awfully blue.<br>
       And every time he stood on his head,<br>
       Everyone screamed, "Go back to bed!"<br>
       And every time he made a leap,<br>
       Everybody fell asleep.<br>
       And every time he ate his tie,<br>
       Everyone began to cry.<br>
       And Cloony could not make any money<br>
       Simply because he was not funny.<br>
       One day he said, "I'll tell this town<br>
       How it feels to be an unfunny clown."<br>
       And he told them all why he looked so sad,<br>
       And he told them all why he felt so bad.<br>
       He told of Pain and Rain and Cold,<br>
       He told of Darkness in his soul,<br>
       And after he finished his tale of woe,<br>
       <h2>I'll tell you the story of Cloony the Clown</h2><br>
       Did everyone cry? Oh no, no, no,<br>
       They laughed until they shook the trees<br>
       With "Hah-Hah-Hahs" and "Hee-Hee-Hees."<br>
       They laughed with howls and yowls and shrieks,<br>
       They laughed all day, they laughed all week,<br>
       They laughed until they had a fit,<br>
       They laughed until their jackets split.<br>
       The laughter spread for miles around<br>
       To every city, every town,<br>
       Over mountains, 'cross the sea,<br>
       From Saint Tropez to Mun San Nee.<br>
       And soon the whole world rang with laughter,<br>
       Lasting till forever after,<br>
       While Cloony stood in the circus tent,<br>
       With his head drooped low and his shoulders bent.<br>
       And he said,"THAT IS NOT WHAT I MEANT -<br>
       I'M FUNNY JUST BY ACCIDENT."<br>
       And while the world laughed outside.<br>
       Cloony the Clown sat down and cried.
